First, the team should have a project manager, which is the person overseeing the entire project and making sure everything goes smoothly. The next role would be for the people actually writing and testing the code, the developers of the project. Finally, there should be someone responsible for expressing what the project plans to accomplish to those who do not understand the coding side of the work.   \n",
    "2. To track our changes to the project, our developers will be responsible for making commits when they edit the project. Git will record our changes and we can view the history of our project by doing so.   \n",

    "4. To make it convenient to work on the project for all of the developers, each dev should create their own branch for their work and make their changes to the project on that branch. The developers will merge their branch to the main branch of the repository by submitting a pull request."

This is a crucial skill for all programmers because every programmer will run into bugs (a lot), so it is important that you have a process to fix these bugs when they arise. The first step to debugging is finding where the bug is and getting an error message. Once you see an error message, you should read it to get an idea of what is going wrong. It is a good idea to copy the error message and Google it to see if there is a good answer online. If the internet did not help, you should use the built-in debugger in your IDE to step through your code line by line. Also, adding print statements to your code is a good idea to see when the code stops working as it should (especially in a loop). "

    "1. I started out by running the code to see if I got an error message, however there was none. This means that the code works fine, but it is not doing what we want it to do. I noticed that the \"sin data\" and \"cos data\" were on two separate plots, although we want them to be on one plot. I looked at the calls for plotting our data and found the issue. We are calling `plt.show` to show the plot before we have called `plt.scatter(x_sin, y_cos, label = \"cos data\")`, I moved this line of code before displaying the graph and it fixed our issue. However, another issue arose after I combined the two plots onto one graph, the second plot was still there but completely empty. This was simply another issue of our calls not being in the right order. I moved `plt.legend()` before `plt.show()` and it fixed our second issue.   \n",
